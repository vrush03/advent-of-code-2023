## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge where participants solve a series of coding puzzles, releasing one per day, from December 1st to December 25th. It's a fun and educational way to improve problem-solving and coding skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by days, with each day corresponding to a new set of challenges. The structure is as follows:

|-- day1/
| |-- day1.go
|-- day2/
| |-- day2.go
|-- ...

sql
Copy code

Each `dayX` directory contains a separate Go file (`dayX.go`) with the implementation of the challenges for that day.

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired day:
   ```bash
   cd dayX
Run the Go file:

bash
Copy code
go run dayX.go
View the output to see the results of the challenges.
